This is a free-to-use program which provides general information about
the squares factors in a given finite word.

It only uses naive algorithms.

To use it from a terminal (Linux/OS X):
- open a terminal 
- have this folder as your current active folder
- type the command "python3 main.py"

Before giving the word, there are some multiple choices. The one with
the capital letter is always the default choice (which means if you type
nothing and press Enter, then the capital-letter choice will be made).
